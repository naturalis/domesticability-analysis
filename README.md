# domesticability-analysis


This repository is for the analysis of the organismal data collected for a large set of Ungulate species.

In this repository you will find the Rmd files for a VIF and Phyloglm analysis, which are sourced within the Pipeline_Analysis.Rmd. If you would like to replicate our results, you can download the pipeline analysis, model selection, and VIF scipts in this repository. All you have to do from there is run the pipeline analysis, as it sources the other scripts and runs the analyses.

Our research aim is to determine which biological traits are relevant for domestication in Ungulates and to determine if we can reliably predict domesticability.
