# domesticability-analysis


This repository is for the analysis of the organismal data collected for a large set of Ungulate species.

In this repository you will find the Rmd files for a VIF, Phyloglm, and Phylostep analysis. 

Our goal is to determine which biological traits are relevant for domestication in Ungulates and to determine if we can reliably predict domesticability.
